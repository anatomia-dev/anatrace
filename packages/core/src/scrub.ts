/**
 * The CANONICAL scrub primitive (D2) — pure + versioned. Replaces absolute home paths,
 * emails, key-shaped tokens, and long hex with fixed glyphs, so a scrubbed slice is
 * deterministic and lower-risk to share. NOTE: it redacts ONLY those structured-secret shapes —
 * it does NOT remove names, free-text content, or anything that isn't a path/email/key/hex token.
 * Treat it as a structured-secret redactor, not a guarantee a slice is safe to publish. anatrace
 * OWNS this vocabulary; crack3d's local
 * `packages/engine/src/scrub.ts` ships the SAME `∎path`/`∎mail`/`∎key`/`∎hex` set and plans
 * to migrate onto these bytes when D ships, so the shared golden is bit-identical TODAY.
 *
 * `SCRUB_VERSION` stamps the vocabulary; the committed cross-repo in/out golden is the actual
 * drift guard (the stamp alone doesn't prevent drift). No code path builds an UNSCRUBBED dossier
 * slice — the slice constructor scrubs internally.
